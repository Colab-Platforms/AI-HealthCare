MESH GRADIENT NOT VISIBLE ON VERCEL - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
============================================================

ISSUE: Mesh gradient background is not visible on Vercel deployment but works locally.

POSSIBLE CAUSES & SOLUTIONS:

1. BUILD CACHE ISSUE
   - Vercel might be using cached build files
   - Solution: Force a fresh deployment
   
   Steps:
   a) Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   b) Select your project
   c) Go to Deployments tab
   d) Click "..." menu on latest deployment
   e) Select "Redeploy" → Check "Use existing Build Cache" OFF
   f) Click "Redeploy"

2. PACKAGE NOT INSTALLED
   - The @paper-design/shaders-react package might not be installed on Vercel
   - Check: Package IS in client/package.json ✓
   
   "@paper-design/shaders-react": "^0.0.70"

3. WEBGL COMPATIBILITY
   - The mesh gradient uses WebGL which might have issues on some browsers
   - The component already has proper error handling
   - Check browser console for WebGL errors

4. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   - No environment variables needed for mesh gradient
   - This is not the issue

5. BUILD CONFIGURATION
   - Vercel build command: vite build
   - This is correct in package.json

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

1. IMMEDIATE FIX - Redeploy without cache:
   - Go to Vercel → Your Project → Deployments
   - Redeploy latest deployment WITHOUT build cache
   - This will force Vercel to rebuild everything fresh

2. VERIFY PACKAGE INSTALLATION:
   - Check deployment logs in Vercel
   - Look for "@paper-design/shaders-react" in npm install logs
   - If missing, the package.json might not be committed

3. CHECK BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
   - Open Vercel URL in different browsers
   - Check browser console for errors
   - WebGL might be disabled in some browsers

4. VERIFY COMPONENT IMPORT:
   - The MeshGradientHero component is properly imported in Landing.jsx ✓
   - The component wraps Hero and Features sections ✓

CURRENT STATUS:
- Package installed: ✓
- Component created: ✓
- Component imported: ✓
- Used in Landing page: ✓
- Pushed to GitHub: ✓

NEXT STEP: Redeploy on Vercel without build cache

If issue persists after redeployment, check:
- Vercel deployment logs for errors
- Browser console on Vercel URL
- Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
