HOW IT WORKS:
=============

User Flow:
1. User clicks "Add Meal"
2. User either:
   a) Takes/uploads photo of food
   b) Types what they ate (e.g., "2 eggs, toast, banana")
3. Clicks "Analyze with AI"
4. GPT-4o Vision analyzes and returns:
   {
     "foodItems": [
       {
         "name": "Scrambled Eggs",
         "quantity": "2 eggs",
         "nutrition": {
           "calories": 140,
           "protein": 12g,

           "fats": 10g,
           ...
         }
       },
       ...
     ],
     "totalNutrition": { ... },
     "analysis": "This is a protein-rich breakfast...",
     "recommendations": "Consider adding vegetables..."
   }
5. User reviews and clicks "Log This Meal"
6. Meal saved to database
7. Daily summary updates automatically
8. Progress bars show goal completion
