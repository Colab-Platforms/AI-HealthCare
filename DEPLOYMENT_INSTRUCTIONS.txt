MESH GRADIENT ISSUE ON VERCEL:
==============================

The mesh gradient code is in GitHub but not visible on Vercel because:
- Vercel is using CACHED build files
- The new package (@paper-design/shaders-react) needs fresh installation

FIX FOR MESH GRADIENT:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Find the latest deployment
5. Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
6. **IMPORTANT**: UNCHECK "Use existing Build Cache"
7. Click "Redeploy"

This will:
- Install @paper-design/shaders-react fresh
- Build the client with mesh gradient
- Deploy the new version

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE UPDATE:
===========================

Don't forget to update in Vercel Dashboard:
- Go to Settings → Environment Variables
- Update OPENROUTER_API_KEY to: 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
- Redeploy after updating

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
======================

After redeployment, verify:
□ Mesh gradient visible on landing page hero and features sections
□ Diet Plan text visible (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)
□ Report Details all in light theme
□ "Ask AI Questions" button removed
□ All text readable and visible
